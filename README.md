work in progress
every function works - currently messing with memIO in order to set up a vector table and a bootable section of ROM, etc

Every instructions work according to my informal testing. Cant run publically available tests before sorting out MEMIO

git not setup to version control the block diagram in vivado - only my source files tracked for now
